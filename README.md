# kill-bandcamp.user.js
Userscript for replacing https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/bandcamp-killer-1-0/

I was previously occasionally using this firefox add-on, but was unhappy with the fact that it wasn't open source. So, I wrote my own.

Enjoy listening to music without constantly being bugged by Bandcamp, but don't forget to pay musicians for their work when you can!
